## How to Play


1. **Objective:** Control the snake to eat food and grow longer without hitting the walls or the snake's own tail.

2. **Controls:** 
   - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to change the direction of the snake.
   - Alternatively, you can use the WASD keys for the same purpose.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - The snake will start with a length of 1 and grow longer each time it eats food.
   - The game speeds up as the snake grows longer, making it more challenging.
   - If the snake collides with the walls or itself or TNT, the game ends.

4. **Scoring:**
   - Each time the snake eats food, the player scores points.
   - The longer the snake gets, the higher the score.
